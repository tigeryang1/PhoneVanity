PhoneVanity
Some people like vanity numbers, which are a combination of numbers and letters. An example, 
1-800-NUMBERS which would be dialed by typing 1-800-686-2377. This is possible because phones have 
3 or 4 characters associated with each digit on the dial pad. 


Assume we have two inputs. A dictionary of words, and an input phone number. 


Write a small piece of code which enumerates all the vanity numbers that are associated with teh input phone number. 

I.e. if the dictionary of words has 

feed 
fee 
fed 
deed 
dead 

and the input number is 4048613332, then the program should output 

404861fee2 
404861fed2 


and if the input number is 4043333111, then the program should output 

404feed111 
404deed111 
404fee3111 
4043fee111 
404fed3111 
4043fed111
